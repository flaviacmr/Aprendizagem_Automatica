Existem duas estratégias que podemos aplicar nesta situação, incluir o maybe como sendo um caso positivo, sendo que pessoas com este tipo de doenças podem ser mais relutantes a responder, ou então criar um classificador com 3 categorias, em que aos Maybe é também atribuída uma probabilidade ter doença mental."
